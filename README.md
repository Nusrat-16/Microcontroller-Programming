# Midi_Project_Microcontroller_Programming

The goal of the project was to implement a communication between the microcontroller
ATmega328P and the synthesizer Korg Minilogue XD through the
MIDI protocol. This provide more flexibility to use all the functionalities of the
synthesizer programmatically. The required hardware for the implementation of
the project includes: a microcontroller, a midi socket, a synthesizer with midi-in
socket and some more electronics devices (Section 5) that would be described
below. This paper includes the overview of MIDI protocol, the hardware design,
software descriptions, future goals and the documentation of the source
code. The aim of the project is to benefit the people who are interested in
programming and music creation.
